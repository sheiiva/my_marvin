The project
----

[**Jenkins**](https://www.jenkins.io/) is the most popular Open Source automation platform. It can automate any task you want, from simple periodic cleanups to full production-scaled deployments. Therefore, it allows to setup the cornerstone of the DevOps chain: the **Continuous Integration** / **Continuous Delivery** (or **Continuous Deployment**) pipeline.You might also have already read or heard about it, going by the name of **CI/CD pipeline**.
